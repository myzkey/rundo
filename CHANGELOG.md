## 0.0.8

### Patch Changes

- f5cdc10: Release v0.0.8: Package manager detection fixes and version check feature

  **Major Improvements:**
  - **Fixed package manager detection**: Now prioritizes lock files over system availability
  - **Added automatic update notifications**: Checks npm registry for latest version with 24-hour caching
  - **Enhanced error handling**: Clear messages when lock file exists but package manager is missing

  **Package Manager Detection:**
  - Detects package manager based on lock files (bun.lockb, pnpm-lock.yaml, yarn.lock, package-lock.json)
  - Throws helpful errors when package manager is not installed
  - Requires explicit package manager setup (no more fallback to npm)
